        <p class="lead mb-4">Psychology is a science that studies human psychological phenomena and their mental functions and behavioral activities under their influence, with both theoretical and practical significance.
Psychology includes basic psychology and applied psychology. Its research involves many fields such as perception, cognition, emotion, thinking, personality, behavioral habits, interpersonal relationship, social relationship, artificial intelligence, IQ, personality and so on. It is also related to many fields of daily life -- family, education, health and society. On the one hand, psychology tries to explain the basic individual behavior and psychological function by using brain operation, and at the same time, psychology also tries to explain the role of individual psychological function in social behavior and social motivation. In addition, it is related to neuroscience, medicine, philosophy, biology, religion and other disciplines, because these disciplines deal with physical or psychological effects that affect the individual mind. In fact, many humanities and natural sciences are related to psychology, and human psychological activities themselves are inseparable from human living environment.
<br><br>

        Psychology is the study of psychological phenomena, consciousness, and behavior in humans and animals [1]. It is both a theoretical discipline and an applied discipline, including theoretical psychology and applied psychology [2].

Psychological research involves many fields such as consciousness, sensation, perception, cognition, emotion, personality, behavior and interpersonal relationship, and influences the development of other disciplines, such as education, management, communication, sociology, economics, psychiatry, statistics, and literature. On the one hand, psychology tries to explain the basic behavior and psychological function of individuals by using brain operation, and at the same time, psychology also tries to explain the role of individual psychological function in social behavior and social motivation. Psychologists engage in basic research to describe, explain, predict and control behavior. Applied psychologists have a fifth aim - to improve the quality of human life. These goals form the basis of a career in psychology.

Psychologists in some fields study human behavior by conducting experiments on animals to predict the effects of environment, physiology (brain damage, whether exercise increases dopamine, etc.), and specific factors. Psychologists also use MRIs, ct scans, and more sophisticated questionnaires to study the human mind. Sometimes they look at brain activity in patients with partial brain damage to see how different parts of the brain function. [<br><br>

        1) Mental process refers to the dynamic process of a person's mental phenomena. It includes the process of cognition, emotion and will, reflecting the common aspect of normal individual psychological phenomena.
The cognitive process is the psychological process of receiving, encoding, storing, extracting and applying cognitive information in practice. It mainly includes sensory perception, thinking, memory and so on.
The emotional process is the experience of an individual's attitude towards things in practice.
Volitional process is a psychological process in which individuals consciously determine goals, adjust and control their own actions according to the goals, and overcome difficulties to achieve predetermined goals.
The above three processes are not isolated from each other, but interrelated and interacting to form three different aspects of individual organic and unified psychological process.
(2) Individual mind is the sum total of various relatively stable psychological phenomena formed by a person in social life practice. Including personality tendency, personality characteristic and personality regulation and so on, reflect the individual side of human psychological phenomenon.
Personality tendency is the dynamic system that impels people to carry out activities. It reflects people's tendency and pursuit of the world around them. It mainly includes needs, motives, interests, ideals, beliefs, values and world views.
Personality characteristics are the essential and stable psychological characteristics that are often displayed on an individual. It mainly includes temperament, character and ability.
